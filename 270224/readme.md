This PHP code defines a JsonCrud class that provides Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality for JSON files. It also defines a JsonCrudException class, which is a custom exception class utilized by the JsonCrud class.
Here's a brief explanation of what each part does:

1.JsonCrudException extends the PHP base Exception class, providing a customized exception that can be thrown within the JsonCrud class methods.
2.JsonCrud class declaration that has methods for interacting with JSON files in various ways.
3.The __construct method that gets invoked whenever a new instance of the JsonCrud class is created. It accepts a file path and assigns it to a private property, $filePath, and checks whether the file exists.
4.The checkFileExists method verifies if a file exists at the provided path. If not, it throws an instance of JsonCrudException.
5.The loadJsonData method reads and decodes the content of the JSON file at $filePath. If an error happens during reading the file or decoding the JSON, it throws an instance of JsonCrudException.
6.The writeJsonData method encodes an array of data to JSON format with pretty print and writes it to the file. If this operation fails, it again throws a JsonCrudException.
7.The getAll method uses loadJsonData to read the entire JSON file and return it as an associative array.
8.The getOne method returns one item from the JSON file that matches the provided ID. If no item matches the ID, it throws a JsonCrudException.
9.The create method generates a unique ID with uniqid(), adds this ID with model as 'users' to the input data array, and appends this to the existing data in the JSON file.
10.The update method updates an existing item that matches the provided ID. It merges the old data of this item with the new input data. If no item matches the ID, again, it throws a JsonCrudException.
11.The delete method removes an item from the JSON file that matches a provided ID. If no item matches the ID, it throws a JsonCrudException.

In essence, this code provides a way to use JSON files as a basic database, providing Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality â€” hence the name JsonCrud.
